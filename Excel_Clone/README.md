# Microsoft Excel Clone
## Overview

- This project is the basic version of Microsoft Excel that is created using HTMI, CSS and JavaScript.
- I tried to create an interface that looks exactly similar to Microsoft Excel.
- The formula Bar that we get in Microsoft Excel is also being simulated in this project with the help of Graph Data Structure.
- One cannot put a cyclic formula and if the user tries to do so then he will be notified via an alert.
- The option to trace the cycle that could get formed is also provided and this is done via a simple animation.

### 2. Formula bar :
- User can use the formulas just as in Microsoft Excel.
- The application also supports the dependent formulas i.e we can enter the formula that is using the value of other cell.
- Example - Formula of cell A2 = (A1 + 10 / 3).
- The two way binding is used so that if one cells value is used then all the cells that were dependent on it also changes their value.
